      <h3>Brief Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        This project, this idea, was something I could relate to because I
        occasionally have to take medication and, frankly, I forget about them.
        I have to tell you, I can’t remember things, and I just need something
        like this, a reminder application that is simple to use and appealing to
        the eye to help me remember these medications. And it’s not only me that
        needs it; my grandmother does as well. Because she can’t use a
        smartphone or an application right now, my sister or I would utilize the
        parental option to take care of her reminders.
      </p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The research and decisions I made when designing this medication
        reminder app are documented in this UI/UX case study. The app provides
        features such as prescription and appointment reminders, as well as a
        parental control function. It took 4 weeks to finish this design
        session.
      </p>
      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>
        Some people find it difficult to learn new apps in this ever-expanding
        digital environment, and people nowadays tend to forget things more
        easily, such as taking their prescriptions. People need a way to
        remember to take their prescriptions without having to learn how to use
        sophisticated programs.
      </p>
      <h3>Main Goal</h3>
      <p>
        Create a basic, easy-to-use app so that users don’t forget their
        medicine schedules, can easily discover pharmacies and clinics near
        them, and can be directed through the app by their loved ones if
        necessary.
      </p>

      <h3>User Persona</h3>

        />

        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Information architecture is a visual representation for the user all
          the features that may be explored within the platform and how to
          access any useful information quickly and easily.
        </p>

        <h3>User Flow</h3>
        <p>
          I started thinking about how the user would use the product after
          developing my personas. Working from their point of view, I designed a
          user flow to show how the user might interact with the product.

          class="casestudy__banner"
        />
        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          I created low-fidelity wireframes after analyzing IA and user flows.
          These are the foundations of an application's user interface that
          effectively organize all of the work that has been done onto a screen.
        </p>

          alt="persona"
          class="casestudy__banner"
        />
        <h3>Final Design</h3>
        <p>
          Hi-Fidelity prototypes incorporate actual content, typefaces, color,
          effects, and branding aspects, as opposed to placeholder in
          low-fidelity wireframe. Polishing the design and making it appealing.

          <strong>Splash Screen:</strong> It captures the attention of users
          with eye-catching graphics. <br /><strong>Onboarding:</strong> It is
          virtual unboxing exeperince that helps users get started with an
          app.<br />
          <strong>Sign in/ Sign up:</strong> We added a quick sign up/sign in

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          I learned from this case study not to allow my own biases and
          preconceptions to influence my design approach. As a designer, it is
          our responsibility to ensure that all design decisions to benefit our
          users, while simultaneously keeping the business model in mind to
          ensure product success.
